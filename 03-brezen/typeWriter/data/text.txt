Frequency analysis is based on the fact that, in any given stretch of written
language, certain letters and combinations of letters occur with varying
frequencies. Moreover, there is a characteristic distribution of letters
that is roughly the same for almost all samples of that language.
For instance, given a section of English language, E, T, A and O are
the most common, while Z, Q and X are rare. Likewise, TH, ER, ON, and AN are
the most common common pairs of letters (termed bigrams or digraphs),
and SS , EE , TT , and FF are the most common repeats.
The nonsense phrase "ETAOIN SHRDLU" represents the 12 most frequent
letters in typical English language text.
In some ciphers, such properties of the natural language plaintext
are preserved in the ciphertext, and these patterns have the potential
to be exploited in a ciphertext-only attack.
